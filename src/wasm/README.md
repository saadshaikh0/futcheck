# Squad Builder - Rust Implementation

A high-performance genetic algorithm implementation for FIFA Ultimate Team squad building, optimized for AWS Lambda deployment.

## Features

- **Single-threaded genetic algorithm** optimized for Lambda constraints
- **Comprehensive constraint system** supporting all EA Sports FC squad building requirements
- **Chemistry calculation** with position assignment and link bonuses
- **Memory efficient** design for serverless deployment
- **Type-safe** implementation with zero-cost abstractions

## Constraints Supported

### Basic Constraints

- Budget limits
- Minimum chemistry
- Minimum squad rating
- Formation requirements

### Advanced Constraints

- **Rarity constraints**: min/max/exactly for bronze/silver/gold players
- **Nationality constraints**: min players from specific nations, min/max unique nations
- **League constraints**: min players from specific leagues, min/max unique leagues
- **Club constraints**: min players from specific clubs, min/max unique clubs
- **Same-value constraints**: min/max players from same nation/league/club
- **Player chemistry**: minimum individual player chemistry requirements
- **Special cards**: Icon and Hero card handling

## Performance

- **Execution time**: 1-5 seconds for typical constraints
- **Memory usage**: 10-20MB for standard player pools
- **Lambda compatible**: Works within 512MB memory limit
- **Cold start**: ~100-200ms initialization

## Usage

### Basic Squad Building

```rust
use squad_builder::*;

// Create player pool
let players = vec![
    Player::new(1, "Haaland".to_string(), 91, vec!["ST".to_string()], 10, 13, 17, 3, 150000),
    // ... more players
];

// Set constraints
let mut constraints = Constraints::default();
constraints.formation = "433".to_string();
constraints.budget = Some(500000);
constraints.min_chemistry = Some(25);

// Run genetic algorithm
let mut ga = GeneticAlgorithm::new(players, constraints);
let best_squad = ga.run()?;

println!("Best squad fitness: {}", best_squad.fitness);
```

### Advanced Constraints

```rust
// Nation constraint: At least 3 English players
constraints.min_nationality = Some(ConstraintValue {
    key: ConstraintKey::Single(14), // England nation ID
    value: 3,
});

// League constraint: At least 4 Premier League players
constraints.min_league = Some(ConstraintValue {
    key: ConstraintKey::Single(13), // Premier League ID
    value: 4,
});

// Max 2 players from same club
constraints.max_same_clubs = Some(2);

// At least 8 gold players (75+ rating)
constraints.min_quality = Some(ConstraintValue {
    key: ConstraintKey::Single(3), // Gold rarity
    value: 8,
});
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **models.rs**: Data structures for Player, Squad, and Constraints
2. **genetic_algorithm.rs**: Main GA implementation with selection, crossover, and mutation
3. **chemistry.rs**: FIFA chemistry calculation with position assignment
4. **constraints.rs**: Comprehensive constraint validation and penalty system
5. **fitness.rs**: Multi-objective fitness function
6. **formation.rs**: Formation position definitions

### Genetic Algorithm Parameters

```rust
population_size: 50,    // Optimized for Lambda
generations: 30,        // Reduced for time constraints
mutation_rate: 0.15,    // Higher for faster convergence
crossover_rate: 0.85,   // High crossover for exploration
elite_size: 10,         // Keep top 20%
tournament_size: 3,     // Small tournament for speed
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
cargo run --bin test_runner
```

Tests include:

- Basic constraint validation
- Complex multi-constraint scenarios
- Rarity and special card constraints
- Performance benchmarking

## Deployment

### AWS Lambda

1. **Build for Lambda**:

   ```bash
   cargo lambda build --release
   ```

2. **Package**:

   ```bash
   cargo lambda deploy
   ```

3. **Memory**: Recommended 512MB-1GB
4. **Timeout**: 30-60 seconds for complex constraints

### Performance Optimizations

- **Single-threaded**: No parallel processing overhead
- **Early termination**: Stops when fitness threshold reached
- **Smart mutation**: Targets worst-performing players
- **Efficient data structures**: HashMap/HashSet for O(1) lookups
- **Memory reuse**: Minimal allocations during evolution
